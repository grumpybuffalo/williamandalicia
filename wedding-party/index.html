They shared a room growing up. Some nights Mom would make Nicholas sleep on the sofa so they would stop talking. Other nights they would compete to fall asleep first. The rule was, anyone who remembered the competition had to say so and check if the other was awake.</div></div></div><div class="party-pair"><div class="party-member"><img class="party-photo" src="paige-kubenka.jpg"><div class="party-name">PAIGE KUBENKA</div><div class="party-title">BRIDESMAID</div><div class="party-description">Alicia's roommate, guinea pig sitter, and the couple's best third wheel.
